<p>I am a senior at Syracuse University in the Whitman School of Management. I am double majoring in Marketing and Retail Management, as well as a double minor in Information Management & Technology and Psychology. On campus, I am involved in a plethora of clubs and organizations, including a social sorority, a dance organization, a volunteer club called Enactus, the Entrepreneurship club, and the challah for hunger organization through Hillel. In my free time, I enjoy baking, shopping at the mall, and hanging out with my friends.  </p>
<p>In terms of my work and professional experience, I have worked as a sales associate at various retail stores such as Bath and Body Works, Mixology Clothing Company, and A'GACI. I interned the past 2 summers at different corporate retail firms. In the summer of 2018, I interned at Haddad Brands, where I did sales for the children's brand Hurley. This past summer, I interned at Macy's and worked in omni-buying for fine watches. I have always had a passion for working in retail and wanted to gain experience working in both the external and internal retail environments, which I gained from working on the floor as a sale associate as well as being in the corporate retail setting.  </p>
