        <h2 class="about-becca">About</h2>
            <p class="me">Hi! I'm Becca Millman and the founder of Bites By Becca. I have always been passionate about baking and have a major sweet tooth! As I try to eat healthy regularly, it has always been difficult for me to satisfy my cravings while trying to lead a healthy lifestyle. This is where I got the inspiration for my company: the idea to create bite-sized desserts to still be able to fulfill that sweet craving but in smaller, more controlled portions. I also am aware of the growing trend of customization, which is why I wanted the option to create your own custom sets of my various product offerings.</p>
        <h3 class="mission">Mission Statement</h3>
            <p class="mission">My mission is to deliver fresh baked, bite-sized desserts to consumers across the globe through a variety of different products and custom flavors.</p>
        <h3 class="vision">Company Vision</h3>
            <p class="vision">My overall vision for the company is to develop a unique brand through our ecommerce platform and eventually grow to various brick-and-mortar locations.</p>
        <h3 class="benefits">Bite-Sized Benefits</h3>
            <p class="benefits">Each of our bite sized desserts can be consumed in 1-3 bites and all range between 50-100 calories per bites. We also plan to add gluten-free and vegan options as we grow to offer products that are suited to anyone with dietary restrictions.</p>
