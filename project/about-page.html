            <p>Hi! I'm Becca Millman and the founder of Bites By Becca. I have always been passionate about baking and have a major sweet tooth! As I try to eat healthy regularly, it has always been difficult for me to satisfy my cravings while trying to lead a healthy lifestyle. This is where I got the inspiration for my company: the idea to create bite-sized desserts to still be able to fulfill that sweet craving but in smaller, more controlled portions. I also am aware of the growing trend of customization, which is why I wanted the option to create your own custom sets of my various product offerings.</p>
        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>My mission is to deliver fresh baked, bite-sized desserts to consumers across the globe through a variety of different products and custom flavors.</p>
        <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>My overall vision for the company is to develop a unique brand through our ecommerce platform and eventually grow to various brick-and-mortar locations.</p>
