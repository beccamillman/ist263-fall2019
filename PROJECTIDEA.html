<title>Becca Millman - IST 263 M002 Project Idea</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>My project idea is to create a website for my future business concept: Bites By Becca. This would be an online bakery that sells a variety of bite-sized desserts. The website would feature a home page, an about me page, a product offering page, and a contact us page. The home page will feature both text and images, while the product offering page will consist of mainly images of my different products. In terms of gathering my content, I will make sure to use google images for photos and cite all the sources I use.
